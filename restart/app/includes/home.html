        <h1>A Clockwork Origin</h1>
        <p>Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. No. We're on the top.</p>
        <h2>A Taste of Freedom</h2>
        <p>Shinier than yours, meatbag. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Moving along&hellip;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</li>
        <li>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?</li>
        <li>Ask her how her day was.</li>
        <li>You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Proposition Infinity</h3>
        <p>You don't know how to do any of those. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Why yes! Thanks for noticing.</p>
