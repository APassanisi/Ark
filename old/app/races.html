        <h2>Human</h2>
        <p>Humans are probably the most numerous and wide spread race. Perhaps well aided by their flexibility and self sufficiency they have expanded at a rate not matched by any other race, and place considerable value on the merits of exploration and discovery.</p>

    <div class="tab-pane fade alert " id="robot">

        <h2>Robot</h2>
        <p>Robots are constructs of metal and gears. Their origins as a race are mostly unknown, even to them. They constantly repair themselves, and as long as they can acquire the necessary parts, are immune to aging. Robot communities are uncommon, and exist mainly to offer maintanaince. Most of the other organic races feel uncomfortable with allowing them to participate in their own communities.</p>

    <div class="tab-pane fade alert " id="barbarian">

        <h2>Barbarian</h2>
        <p>Barbarians are generally characterized as a rough, somewhat primitive people, and while their society has advanced beyond a tribal level, they maintain many aspects of tribal culture even today. They are naturally warlike and have a strong affinity for combat. Barbarians also have a strong sense of loyalty, honor, and justice, and admire these qualities in others. They are generally not a deeply intellectual or philisophical race, and even the religious among them tend to prefer simple, physical pleasures to intensive study or mental challenges. </p>

    <div class="tab-pane fade alert " id="dwarf">

        <h2>Dwarf</h2>
        <p>The dwarves are an old, hardy race, older than the humans and possibly even older than the elves. They live within the earth, in a harmony that often boggles more surface-bound races - even a hill dwarf can sniff a handful of dirt and tell whether it would be good for planting crops, for example. Their mountain cousins, meanwhile, have such a keen sense of the stone around them that they can tell worked stone from natural hollows, and even how far down they are.</p>

    <div class="tab-pane fade alert" id="elf">

        <h2>Elf</h2>
        <p>The Elvesâ€™ very slenderness tends to make them seem taller than Humans, though their actual size varies depending on where they call 
        home. The most common variety hail from forests, but ones living in mountains or seas are not unknown. Wherever they come from, they all share an affinity for nature and a sense of duty toward the animals and things of their native environment.</p>
